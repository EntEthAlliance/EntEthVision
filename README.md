# This repository is obsolete and has been archived

This repostiory was used for a "Vision Paper" describing technologies and standards that are relevant to members of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. 
The Vision Paper was intended to evolve based on feedback and details highlighted by EEA members, such as short term and long term goals. 

But by and large that didn't happen, and the repository is now largely obsolete.
