  abstract             = {{WSDL} is an {XML} format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). {WSDL} is extensible to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate, however, the only bindings described in this document describe how to use {WSDL} in conjunction with {SOAP} 1.1, {HTTP} {GET}/{POST}, and {MIME}},
